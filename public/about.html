<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hey there! I'm Faraz Bin Tariq, an aspiring Full Stack Developer from New Delhi, India. With a background in Computer Science and a strong foundation in data analytics, I’m now diving deep into the world of web development to build modern, scalable, and interactive applications.</p>

<p>I'm currently enrolled in <strong>"The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp"</strong> by Angela Yu on Udemy, where I’m learning everything from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This journey has been both challenging and exciting, and I’m loving every bit of it!</p>

<p>Previously, I worked on projects related to data analysis and machine learning, but now I’m shifting gears to become a well-rounded developer who can handle both frontend and backend like a pro. I’m passionate about building real-world apps, solving problems, and continuously leveling up my skills.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading survival stories, exploring new tech trends, and helping others find solutions to their tech-related problems.</p>
